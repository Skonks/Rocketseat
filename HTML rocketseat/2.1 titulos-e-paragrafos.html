<h1>Background</h1>
<p>
  Yukie was born as the eldest of two daughters of the Sword Saint Taisei
  Mayuzumi and his wife in the Ishikawa prefecture in the Hokuriku region. Being
  the elder, Yukie began training in the Mayuzumi style of swordsmanship since
  she was young in order to succeed her father. Her father was able to get
  permission for him to carry a real katana, and he passed this honor onto his
  daughter. Along with her sword training, Yukie was also taught proper home
  etiquette and manners by her mother.
