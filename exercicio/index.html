      Ni Koi Shinasai! anime and manga. She is a newcomer to the Kazama Family

      Majikoi! S.
      Yukie is the recent and latest addition to the Four Devas, a group made of

    <h2 id="chris">Christiane Friedrich</h2>
    Christiane Friedrich (クリスティアーネ・フリードリヒ, Kurisutiāne
    Furīdorihi), also known as Chris (クリス Kurisu), is one of the main
    heroines in Maji De Watashi Ni Koi Shinasai!. She is a main character in the
    anime and the manga that is being published by Ace Comp Ace and one Yamato
    Naoe's love interests in Majikoi!.
    Chris is also one of the members of the Kazama Family and the sole member of the group from Germany as a transfer
    student of Kawakami Academy. She loves Japanese culture and the reason she
    came to Japan is to recognize her interest towards Japanese culture and
    things related to Japan. Unsurprisingly, Chris's familiarity with Japanese
    history as well as the military background of her family has also made her a
    decent strategist and a natural leader when called for.
